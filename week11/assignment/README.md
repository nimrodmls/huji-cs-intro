# Boggle Game - Exercise 11

## Game Extras

1. **Pausing** - It is possible for the player to pause the game indefinitely. When the player pauses the game, all the letter buttons are hidden from sight and the timer freezes. The player can resume at any time.
2. **Pause Menu** - When the game is paused, a pause menu appears, allowing the player to either reset the game or choose a difficulty level (see below).
3. **Difficulty Level** - The player can decide between normal or hard difficulty at the pause menu. Hard difficulty is with penalties involved, with -5 points and -5 seconds, for each word which doesn't exist or repeated.
4. **Hints** - At the end of each round, hints are added to the collection, allowing the player to see clearly which words he/she had missed. The letter buttons are not hidden after the game round ends for the same purpose.
5. **Eastereggs** - Some special prompts when the player has 2 or more sequential mistakes. 5 mistakes have further special prompt.
