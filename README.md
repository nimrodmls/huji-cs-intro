# HUJI CS Intro Course

My solutions for all the exercises of the Introduction to Computer Science of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2022-2023 Fall Semester.

If you're a fellow HUJI student who didn't complete the course - You're highly encouraged to exit this repository and solve everything by your own. 
I am in no way responsible for any outcome of using this code for your academics, whether you're HUJI student or not.

Some solutions use practices which weren't taught by the time of writing the solution.

All exercieses received 100/100 grade in automated tests, apart from EX5 (95), EX10 (96.15), EX11 (89.45). To those, the tests feedback is attached in their respective folders, I had no motive to fix those bugs.
