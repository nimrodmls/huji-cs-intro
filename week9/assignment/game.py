        Note - this function is here to guide you and it is *not mandatory*
        to implement it. 

        The function runs one round of the game :
            1. Get user's input of: what color car to move, and what 
                direction to move it.
            2. Check if the input is valid.
            3. Try moving car according to user's input.

        Before and after every stage of a turn, you may print additional 
        information for the user, e.g., printing the board. In particular,
        you may support additional features, (e.g., hints) as long as they
        don't interfere with the API.
